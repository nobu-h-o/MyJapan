MyJapan is a web application that allows foreign tourists in Japan to get custom-made travel plans based on their preferences and personalities. It is available at the link in the 'about' section. Currently, it is unavailable on phones and other small screens.
## Technologies
MyJapan uses vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js and Express.js for the backend. It also uses the OpenAI API and Maps API to create the responses.
